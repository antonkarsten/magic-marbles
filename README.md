# RxJS and Jasmine Marbles competition

The PRIZE: https://www.lebkuchen-schmidt.com/de/festtags-truhe-2020-p2051/ (since it will soon be christmas. And Christmas in Germany means Lebkuchen)

## How does it work?

On Mon 19th, Tue 20th, Wed 21st, Thu 22nd and Mon 26th you will receive 2 questions before the daily at 10:15 am. The deadline is 10:15 am the next day.

So there will be 10 questions. If you submit a correct anwser before the deadline you get 1 point. If there is a tie at the end there will be one extra tie-break question.

Inside the `src` folder there is a folder for each question. Every question has a README that explains what to do.

If there are example in the README of the question, you can run them with `npm run example1` (for example1).

You can run the questions with `npm run question1` (for question 1).

I will push the questions and the solutions of the previous day to the `main` branch every day.

You can send the answers to each question to me in a private chat in Teams or in an email. (make sure you dont send them to the group. And dont commit them to the repo or make PRs etc)

## Before you start

clone this repository and run `npm install`. If you have any problems running the examples or question or you are new to node, npm etc. Do not hesitate to write me on Teams.
